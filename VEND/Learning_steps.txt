As a Christian-believer the ways to attain anything are laid bare in the Logos:
And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.
Consider what I say; and the Lord give me understanding in all things. 2 Tim 2.5

If it is software related;
Firstly is it expedient to acquire this skill or experience
If it indeed is, How and why? this helps to train my mind to understand the weight and avert future writer's block and distractions whilst learning
To have a perfect understanding; look up successful projects and creators of this skill or experience
How is this task solving a problem, are there any variations that I may to accomplish the same task

When all these are checked, look up documentation, and start trying the skill to build or solve the task at hand
Engaging with communities that are indulged in this skill and find if any in my vicinity
Minimal youtube and A.I tools for any errors encountered
Keep Building and learning;
Skill is as a muscle: I've learned by Gym experience
Once pull-ups are hard and then they are not!

Above all, Serving a man/woman within my reach who has been able to learn this skill or has this experience as skills are
easily imparted than learning

If Real-life situation
SERVICE to a man is the easiest way and google ;-)
