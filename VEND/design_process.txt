Scannable Content:
Break up content into easily scannable sections using headings, bullet points, and short paragraphs. This format helps users quickly understand the content.

Limited Distractions:
Minimising distractions and unnecessary elements that might divert users' attention from the main goal. Keep the focus on the key message and action you want users to take.

Responsive Design:
The landing page must be responsive and adapt to various screen sizes and devices. Mobile-friendly design is crucial as a significant portion of users access websites on mobile devices.

User-Centred Design:
The design should prioritise the needs and preferences of my target audience. Understanding user personas, behaviour patterns, and preferences is essential to create a design that resonates with users.

Clear and Compelling Messaging:
The landing page's messaging should be concise, clear, and compelling. It should immediately communicate the value proposition or purpose of the page to visitors. A strong headline, subheadline, and supporting text can help achieve this.

Color Scheme and Branding:
The colour scheme should align with the brand's identity and evoke the right emotions in users. Consistent use of colours creates a cohesive design and helps reinforce brand recognition.

Visual Consistency:
Maintaining a consistent design language throughout the landing page enhances the user experience. Elements like buttons, icons, and headings should have a uniform appearance.
